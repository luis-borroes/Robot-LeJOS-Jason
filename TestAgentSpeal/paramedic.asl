// Paramedic Agent
// 23rd November 2018 - Terry Payne
// This is the AgentSpeak code for an example paramedic agent, that
// responds to a call to assist in rescuing victims, based on triaging
// possible victims in a number of candidate locations.  This is partially
// achieved using the CONTRACT NET PROTOCOL, based on the code that was
// presented in the COMP329 Lectures: 24-25 Communication through AgentSpeak 
//
// Differences from the CNP Code
// 1) The definition of the plan @c1 for the addition of the cfp belief
// has been extended to accept calls that include additional information
// regarding the number of critical and non-critical victims.  These are
// then included in the mental note proposal(CNPId,Task,C,NC,Offer);
//
// 2) The rule for accepting the contract, @r1 +accept_proposal() has been
// extended with two other achievement tasks: 
//    !getScenario(A) - this obtains the beliefs regarding the location of 
//    the obstacles, the victim locations and the hospital
//
//    startRescueMission(A,C,NC) - this mental note is created if the cfp
//    was successful, and the request for locations was successfully sent.
//    We cannot immediately start the mission, until we have all the beliefs,
//    and so there are two plans that respond to the creation of this belief;
//    one that checks if we have the location information, which then is the
//    starting point for the mission.  The other simply waits for a couple of
//    seconds and then replaces the mental note, which should cause one of the
//    plans to be recursively generated.

// In this assignment, only one agent will participate in the solution, and
// so the value generated here is somewhat arbitrary!
